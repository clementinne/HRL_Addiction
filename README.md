Codes implemented for the project 'Homeostatic Reinforcement Learning Approaches to Model Addiction'.

The file HomeoEnv2D.py allows to run simulations of the control agent (section 8.2 of the report), 
the addicted agent under the definition of addiction as an allostatic increase of drug-related HS (section 8.3.1 of the report),
and of an agent evolving in a homeostatic space with alternative drives (section 8.3.3 of the report).

The file ModularAgentEnv.py allows to run simulations of the modular agent as defined in section 8.3.2 of the report.

Codes are inspired from two articles : 'Homeostatic reinforcement learning for integrating reward collection and physiological stability', Keramati and Gutkin, 2014 
and 'Having multiple selves helps learning agents explore and adapt in complex changing worlds', Dulberg et al, 2023
